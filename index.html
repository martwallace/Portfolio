<h2>About Me</h2>

<img src="Professional Headshot alt=picture of me">

<p>My name is Martha Wallace and I am a full-stack web developer. I have seven years working for Oil & Gas startups and have, over this tenure, created several simple apps to make sales, inventory, and accounting processes more efficient. I enjoy solving problems! 
    In the past two years I have been able to hone my skills as a Salesforce Administrator as well as the admin for our instance of FieldFX (Liquid Frameworks software). I am someone who enjoys challenges, and enjoys the fact the no two days are the same – I love learning something new every single day. 
    My experience with startups has given me three invaluable skillsets: </p>
    <ol>
     
            <li>I am a quick learner </li>
     
           <li>I am comfortable being uncomfortable (after all, that is an inherent feature of learning new skills)</li>
     
           <li>I like to fine tune processes to make them as efficient as possible</li>
     
         </ol>
   
    <p>
        When I am not working on my programming skills, I enjoy travelling, competitive trivia, reading political or comedic biographies (Tine Fey’s <i>Bossypants</i> has become a yearly read), and trying beers in every city or country I visit – Iceland’s Surtur Nr. 47 became a dinner staple on my road trip to the land of Ice and Fire.
