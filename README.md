The website is a overview of mThis website encompasses an overview of my work – with small strokes of myself embedded in it. I hope you enjoy viewing as much as I enjoyed making each project. I firmly believe that in order to do something well, you must enjoy what you do. I have had the great fortune of working for and with people who have changed my life for the better – they have allowed me room to grow, make mistakes, and be creative. I realize how truly rare that is in most workplaces. Thanks to their unwavering support I found myself coming to Coding Bootcamp, not only to learn a new skill but to allow me a new venue to express my creativity, while still contributing to our corporate values.

Since I work for Oil and Gas, most of my technical projects are tailored for that industry – since I see room for efficiency every single day at work. However, I am always looking for a new challenge to venture into. 

Thanks again for visiting my site!
